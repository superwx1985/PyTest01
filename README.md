Python &amp; selenium

This project is an automation test project for The Knot Wedding Shop (KWS). I use Python 3.4.1 + selenium 2.44.0 to build up it.

In this project, 'KWS' is the main folder, and just igrone 'vic_test' :)

In 'KWS', run 'start.py' to begin the test. 'send_report.py' is the module for report sending. 'Verification.py' is the module for verifiy web element. 'MyTestCase.py' is a sub-class with unittest.TestCase. And the test cases were all put in 'test_case' folder.
